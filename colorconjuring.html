In the past, by lack of better judgement and being a total beginner, I either chose the most vivid or the closest color for what I thought I wanted and got stuck with it and only changed them by using burn/dodge which is usually not the most accurate and best approach to shading. I often ended up with muddy and dirty, inconsisitent colors.<br/>Of course if one doesn't use a prepared palette, then colors </span>
  <span class="textstyle5">can</span>
  <span class="textstyle4"> be inconsistent when the original base color get lost in time. I don't do palettes. Why? Because I don't work like that. I prefer to go by heart, storing all the references in my head. I'm also lazy and I like to not follow standard practices. So what was the solution to fix my color theory?<br/><br/>AI...<br/><br/>Well, not up-close. We don't do AI here. However, it didn't stop me from thinking about how it did the thing it was made to do. In a sense, I wanted to paint like AI at that moment. So I fired up my favourite painting software (GIMP) and started to work on some random stuff, utilising every tool I thought would make me achive the look, for example, using Heal Tool  to copy random edges, corners, bumps to add little details to other places and also to fine blend to make very smooth surfaces and melt things together.<br/><br/>GIMP lets you operate on RGB channels separately by activating/deactivating them. That allowed me to add chromatic abberation with Warp tool by offsetting the channels in places I wanted. That added a bit of realism to the painting the way it was mixed and also it became a method for adding subsurface scattering effect by slightly offsetting the Red channel.<br/>Anyways, that's how color conjuring born. Thanks to mocking AI, I discovered that I can use various tools to operate on isolated color channels in GIMP which are by themselves are greyscale so I thought I could use the dodge/burn tool to paint and it worked!<br/><br/>From there on, I could put whatever color on the canvas or just start with pure black background and using the channels one by one with burn/dodge I could conjure up whatever color or bend existing colors towards a certain hue, value right there on the canvas using the surrounding colors as reference. This is basically what color conjuring is all about.<br/><br/>In the last 4 years (it's 2024) I spent messing around with different color conjuring methods to make color theory more accessible for a lazy and dumb person like myself. I don't know if these methods also do the same favour to other people because in my time of researching them, I inevitably learned a thing or few.<br/><br/>I have to say, I'm a destructive artist when it comes to painting. I used to say &quot;If AI can paint on one layer so can I&quot;. I'm also heavily inspired by 3d/rendering engines so my domain is the world of lineless and realism. I'm also a mouse user so lineart is obviously not the part of my workflow, unless I start working on making it accessible to myself. Nevertheless, color conjuring is something I will keep using forever probably.</span>

Yay!<br/>You can use whatever color honestly, the core of this method is the use of Addition mode with a low value. Addition adds values to the 3 main color channels so every stroke/stamp will become brighter and brighter. I use Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black and White to conjure because these colors are the 3 main colors and then their direct opposites. Opposites are used to substract from the main 3, but these days I don't use Substract mode to do that, instead I use Grain Merge because it gives a more expected result.<br/>In GIMP there are two sub-modes for most of the blending modes which are normal and legacy. Normal can be used for blocking out a scene or object on a transparent canvas, while legacy respects transparency.</span>

A denoising method is used to average the values of the pixels. In my practice, I use a jittered smudge tool with a soft brush. It has an option to never reduce opacity so I can work against transparent backgrounds.<br/><br/>I mainly use the Additive version of this method because it is way more predictable.<br/><br/>Altough this technique is invented for coloring, pixel cloud + denoise is very suitable to block out a scene or object with any chosen color.</span>
